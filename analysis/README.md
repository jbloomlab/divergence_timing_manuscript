# Divergence Timing Analysis

This directory contain the data and code to perform the analysis.

The analysis is organized as follows:

1. [`./HA/`](./HA/): This directory contains the data and code to analyze influenza virus HA trees.   
2. [`./decay_to_stationary/`](./decay_to_stationary/): This directory contains the code to analyze the differences in stationary state of the four different models.
3. [`./simulations/`](./simulations/): This directory contains the code to analyze the performance of the models on sequences simulated under an `ExpCM`.
4. [`./bin/`](./bin/): This directory contains binaries.


## To do ideas

1. Summary plot for decay to stationary state which does involve cherrypicking sites. Something to do with effective number of codons?
