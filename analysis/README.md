# Divergence Timing Analysis

This directory contain the data and code to perform the analysis.

The analysis is organized as follows:

1. [`./HA/`](./HA/): This directory contains the data and code to analyze influenza virus HA trees.   
2. [`./decay_to_stationary/`](./decay_to_stationary/): This directory contains the code to analyze the difference in expected pairwise identity for GY94 models and ExpCM's.
3. [`./phylobayes/`](./phylobayes/): This directory contains the code to compare `ExpCM`'s to the pbMutSel model implemented in `PhyloBayes-MPI`.
3. [`./simulations/`](./simulations/): This directory contains the code to analyze the performance of the models on sequences simulated under an ExpCM.
