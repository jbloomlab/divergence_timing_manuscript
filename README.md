# Divergence Timing Manuscript

This repository is for the project by Sarah Hilton and Jesse Bloom analyzing the effect of site-specific stationary state substitution models on the estimation of long branch lengths.
Specifically, it looks at the difference of HA tree branch lengths using ExpCMs and YNGKP models.

The manuscript is titled "Experimentally informed site-specific substitution models deepen phylogenetic estimates of the divergence of viral lineages."

This repo contains the following directories

[`./manuscript/`](./manuscript/): contains the manuscript describing the project.
